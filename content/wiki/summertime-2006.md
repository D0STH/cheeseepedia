**Birthday Break**: April 2005 show logo with music set to a 1 minute, 2 minute countdown. This would then lead into the Birthday show.
No USA Version - The Stand Alone Song, 'America', and the 2005 Military Montage intermission do not appear in this show due to some sort of 'controversy' about the subject matter.
Intermissions - As before, the CPMN episode has been changed. 2003 had Episode 3, 2004/2005 had Episode 1, and for this year it is the recent Episode 6.
